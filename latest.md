# Arch Linux Installation Notes

## Current Status
- **Installation Stage**: Configuring system (hostname, locale, GRUB).
- **Environment**: Chrooted into `/mnt` on the target disk.
- **Objective**: Minimal Arch Linux setup with Hyperland GUI.

---

## System Configuration
1. **Disk Partitioning**:
   - `/dev/sda1`: EFI partition (512MB, FAT32).
   - `/dev/sda2`: Root partition (~114GB, ext4).

2. **Network**:
   - Wi-Fi setup pending with `nmtui` after base system reboot.

3. **Locale and Timezone**:
   - Timezone: `Region/City` (to be set).
   - Locale: `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`.

4. **Bootloader**:
   - GRUB installed to `/boot` using EFI.

## Next Steps
1. Verify `GRUB` works after reboot.
2. Install essential packages (e.g., nano, Firefox, git).
3. Install Hyperland as the GUI environment.

## Questions/Challenges
- Is additional software needed (e.g., audio tools, graphics drivers)?
- What themes/configurations should be pre-installed for Hyperland?
